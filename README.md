# PyFiche

PyFiche is a simple pastebin optimized for the command line, written in Python
and heavily inspired by [fiche](https://github.com/solusipse/fiche/), or rather
a shameless translation. It has no dependencies outside the Python standard
library.

It also comes with a re-implementation of Lines, the HTTP server that comes
with Fiche, which this time around also allows you to upload files using POST
requests. Additionally, PyFiche also comes with a simple TCP server, Recup,
to download pastes through netcat without using HTTP(S), in the same way you
upload them.

## Installation

### Dependencies

- Python 3 (tested with 3.11)

### Local Installation

```bash
$ python -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -U git+https://kumig.it/PrivateCoffee/pyfiche.git
```

## Usage

### Fiche Server

```bash
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pyfiche-server # try --help for options
```

With the exception of the `-u` option, all arguments of the original Fiche
should work as expected. `-u` is not implemented because, well, just use the
right user in the first place. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

#### Uploading files

```bash
$ nc <server> <port> < <file>
```

### Recup Server

```bash
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pyfiche-recup # try --help for options
```

#### Downloading files

Pipe the ID of an uploaded file to `nc`:

```bash
$ echo <id> | nc <server> <port> > <file>
```

### Lines Server

```bash
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pyfiche-lines # try --help for options
```

#### Viewing pastes in a browser

Go to `http://<server>:<port>/<id>`.

#### Downloading raw pastes

```bash
$ curl http://<server>:<port>/<id>/raw
```

#### Uploading pastes

```bash
$ curl -X POST -d '<paste content>' http://<server>:<port>
```

Or use a file:

```bash
$ curl -X POST -d @<file> http://<server>:<port>
```
